For this project, I looked at the data and considered the following questions:

--1. Which industries offer the most generous maternity leave policies on average?
--2. Is there a correlation between paid time off days and average employee tenure?
--3. Do companies that provide healthcare benefits have higher average employee tenure than those that donâ€™t?
--4. What is the average revenue per employee for each company, and which company is the most efficient by that measure?
--5. Which companies in the dataset offer above-average benefits in both maternity leave and paid time off?

SELECT industry, ROUND(AVG(maternity_leave_weeks),2) AS maternity_leave_average
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry
HAVING maternity_leave_average > 8
;

SELECT company_name, paid_time_off_days, avg_employee_tenure
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE paid_time_off_days > 10
  AND avg_employee_tenure > 5
ORDER BY avg_employee_tenure asc
;

SELECT company_name, avg_employee_tenure,
CASE WHEN healthcare_benefits > 0 THEN 'Coverage Provided'
ELSE 'No Coverage'
END AS "Health Benefits"
